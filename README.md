# Hydrogen (Satyrn's 1.16.5 Fork)

Hydrogen is a free and open-source mod designed to reduce the game's memory requirements by implementing more
memory-efficient data structures and logic. It's primarily designed for more heavily modded scenarios, but can
offer (small) improvements even in lightly modded or vanilla scenarios. The mod works on both the **client and
server**, and **doesn't require the mod to be installed on both sides**. However, the benefits of running
Hydrogen on the server are pretty small as of the moment.
